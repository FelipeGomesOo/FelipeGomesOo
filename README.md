# Hey! I'm Felipe.

I'm a brazilian interdisciplinary designer & frontend developer currently working as freelancer.  

My journey into programming began in 2010, during my first year of college, when I landed my first internship as a web designer. Here I quickly grasped the significance of prototyping, rigorous testing, and seamless project implementation. Since then, I've been witnessing web's evolution, working with tools such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and WordPress.

Today, my primary focus is on developing React applications, always emphasizing componentization, state management and event handling. I have experience with React Router, Context API, asynchronous requests, and integration with external APIs. In addition, I'm interested in testing practices and build tools.
